<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Stem Cells Cryopreservation Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquid Phase</li><li>Vapor Phase</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The stem cells cryopreservation equipment market is categorized into two main types: liquid phase and vapor phase. Liquid phase cryopreservation involves storing biological samples in liquid nitrogen, which maintains a constant temperature around -196°C, ensuring optimal preservation. In contrast, vapor phase cryopreservation uses the gaseous nitrogen above the liquid nitrogen level, allowing for a slightly higher temperature while still providing adequate preservation. Both methods are crucial for maintaining cell viability and functionality during long-term storage of stem cells.</p></p>
